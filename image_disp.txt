                             10 February 2020

image_disp <options>

Display an image or sequence of images.  Each image is maximally scaled
and centered in the display area.  Unused display area, if any, is set to
black.

See the IMAGE_TYPES documentation file for a description of the supported
image file formats and any associated restrictions.


Command Line Options

  <image file name>

    Any command line option that does not start with a dash (-) is assumed
    to be the name of an image file to display.  Images will be displayed
    in the sequence they were encountered on the command line.

  -LIST <list file name>

    Supply a list of images to display.  Each line of the list file
    contains one image file name, except that empty lines and empty file
    names are ignored.

    The images from the images list file will be added to the total list
    of images to display.  Images will be displayed in the order of the
    command line options which caused them to be added to the list. Images
    within a list file are displayed in top to bottom order.

  -DEV <RENDlib device specifier string>

    Explicitly set the RENDlib device to use for drawing.  The default is
    to use the IMAGE_DISP logical RENDlib device.  For more information on
    RENDlib logical devices, see the RENDLIB_DEV documentation file.

  -SCREEN

    Use the whole screen, if possible, to display the image.

  -LOOP

    Makes the images list circular.  The image position wraps from the
    last to the first when moving forward, and from the first to the last
    when moving backward.
